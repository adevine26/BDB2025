# BDB2025

This is the code I created and used for my NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 project. For this, I created a model predicting defensive schemes based on various game, play, player, and tracking metrics. 
The main files should be run in the following order:
1. Feature Engineering.Rmd
2. Model - Logistic Regression.Rmd
3. Extra Model Results.Rmd
